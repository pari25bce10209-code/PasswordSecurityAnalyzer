# 🔐 Password Security Assessment & Resilience Analyzer

## Overview
The **Password Security Assessment & Resilience Analyzer** is an ideathon project focused on addressing one of the most common yet critical cybersecurity vulnerabilities: **weak, human-generated passwords**.  
This project combines **security analysis and user education** to promote strong password hygiene and resilient digital behavior.

The solution aligns with the theme:  
> **Innovation for a Secure and Sustainable Future**

---

## Problem Statement
Despite increasing cyber threats, many users continue to create weak passwords without understanding the associated risks.

### Key Issues Identified
- Preference for convenience over security  
- Lack of awareness about password entropy  
- Reuse of common and predictable passwords  
- Growing brute-force, dictionary, and credential-stuffing attacks  

These issues often lead to:
- Data breaches  
- Identity theft  
- Unauthorized system access  

---

## Project Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are to:

- Educate users on what makes a password secure  
- Prevent weak password creation practices  
- Demonstrate real-world cybersecurity risks  
- Encourage long-term adoption of secure password habits  

---

## Proposed Solution
We propose a **web-based Password Security Assessment & Resilience Analyzer** that:

1. Allows users to input a password securely  
2. Analyzes password strength in real time  
3. Classifies passwords as:
   - Weak  
   - Medium  
   - Strong  
4. Provides actionable feedback to improve password security  

The solution acts as a **preventive cybersecurity tool**, focusing on awareness and behavior change rather than post-incident response.

## Core Features

### Password Input Interface
- Secure, masked input field  
- Real-time strength evaluation  

### Strength Evaluation Logic
Passwords are evaluated based on:
- Length  
- Use of uppercase and lowercase characters  
- Numbers and special characters  
- Repeated patterns or sequences  
- Common and dictionary-based password checks  

### Feedback & Suggestions
Users receive clear recommendations such as:
- Increase password length  
- Add special characters  
- Avoid dictionary words  
- Avoid repeated characters

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- HTML 

### Backend *(Optional / Extended Version)*
- JAVA and JAVA SPRING
- Secure API for password evaluation logic  

### Libraries & Tools
- **zxcvbn** – password strength estimator  
- Regular Expressions (Regex) for validation  
- springboot.io
